I'm a penultimate year student at the University of Exeter studying a dual honours in Computer Science and Economics! I'm passionate about the many ways technology can be applied to finance. Some of my favourite technologies to work with are C++, Python, and SQL although I have experience in others too. I'm currently looking for a summer internship to help me grow and be mentored by legends in the field! Check out some of my university and side projects below.
