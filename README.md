# Hello World, I'm Greg 👋

I'm a penultimate year student at the University of Exeter studying a dual honours in Computer Science and Economics! I'm passionate about the many ways technology can be applied to finance. Some of my favourite languages to work with are C++, Python, and SQL although I have experience in others too. Please check out some of the university coursework and side projects I've displayed on my profile.
